# Six-Nations-Rugby-App
Java/Microsoft Access system to establish the fixtures, input and display scores and points, and display a league table for the Six Nations Rugby Tournament.

Originally a group project for the MSc in Software Development in Queen's University of Belfast,
I have designed this system without reference to any previous efforts. 

This system is under construction.  

Fixture setting objects are working (see test classes).
Objects for input of match scores, calculation of match points, and population of league tables are under construcion.
A GUI to be developed last.
