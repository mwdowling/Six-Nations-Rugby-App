# Six-Nations-Rugby-App
A Java/MSAccess system to establish the fixtures, input and display match scores, and display round results and a league table for the Six Nations Rugby Tournament.

Originally a group project for the MSc in Software Development in Queen's University of Belfast,
I have designed this system without reference to any previous efforts. 

See Requirements specification in repository. 

App is under construction. Progress on requirements:

1.	DONE Fixture setting objects complete.
2.	TODO GUI for user entry of scores.
3.	TODO bulk upload of round results. 
4.	DONE league table. 
6.	TODO league table display in descending order of points.
7.	DONE persistent data.
8.	TODO search facility for results and league table.
